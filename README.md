        /**
        * @param views the list of views that you want to include in the banner
        * @param titles the list of titles that appears as tabs at the bottom
        * @param intervalSeconds the interval of auto scrolling, set to 2 in sample
        * @param animationMillis the scrolling's animation time, set to 500 in sample
        * @param int logoResourceId | Bitmap logoBitmap the logo you want to display.
                You can skip this param if you don't want it.
        */
        mDecentBanner.start(List<View> views, List<String> titles, int intervalSeconds,
                int animationMillis[, int logoResourceId | Bitmap logoBitmap]);

* Note that when you want to show less than 3 views, you need to extend the views to be no less than three items. When you want to display 2 views, your titles param should contain 2 items and your views param should contain 4 items as ABAB

* You can call the following two methods to start/stop auto scrolling.

        mDecentBanner.startAutoPlay();
        mDecentBanner.stopAutoPlay();
